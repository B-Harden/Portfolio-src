The "radio" pictures are from an interview I was selected for where the topic was about leadership conducted by Lurone Jennings (Head of Chattanooga's Youth & Family Development Department)

The "peace" photo is from an event co-hosted by the city of Chattanooga and my fraternity (Alpha Phi Alpha) that promoted peace to youth and the city.
